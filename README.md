# odin-recipes

This project demonstrates a simple representation of just using HTML to create certain 'recipes'. 
Presenting the usage of links to other pages of the website as well as using ordered and unordered lists 
with clear representation of using images to give an idea on what the recipe is. 
Even giving importance to headers throughout.
